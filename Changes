  * So I'm being a bad boy and doing it again. Time for another take.
    This time I'd like everybody's input.

    RATIONALE: I wrote the code for Google::Chart (after having received
    maintainership from Marcel) when I was going crazy about Roles,
    but I can't say I had the appropriate knowledge to deal with them.
   
    In this release, I've fixed what I can, organized things a bit better,
    and conjured up what I believe to be a saner API.

  * Significant <BACKWARD IMCOMPATIBLE> Changes
    - New syntax

        my $g = Google::Chart->create(
          $type => %args
        );
        $g->add_dataset(...);

    - Most operations are now done against the main chart object via
      add_* calls:

        $g->add_axis( ... );
        $g->add_dataset( ... );
        $g->add_range_fill( ... );

    - Related to the above, since we now cover most of the gory details in
      method calls, lots of object deprecated, or made invisible to 
      regular users.
      Things like markers, fill objects, etc, are now hidden.

0.05014 - 21 Aug 2009
  * Having completely forgotten about releasing a prod release for
    4 months, I now version++ at the prodding of Adam Kennedy ;) 

0.05014_01 - 30 Apr 2009
  * Apply changes from Mike Schilli

  (ms) Added support for XY type graphs
  (ms) Added Google::Chart::Title support in Google::Chart
  (ms) Added Google::Chart::Margin support
  (ms) Google::Chart::Fill::LinearGradient now supports transitions from
       color1/offset1 to color2/offset2 
  (ms) Added 'D' option in Google::Chart::Marker for line and bar chart 
       line styles

  * TODO: Now that we (well, /I/) know more about meta programming, perhaps
    there was an easier way to add the various functionalities using Roles?
