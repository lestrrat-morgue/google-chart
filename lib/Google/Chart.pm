=head1 NAME

Google::Chart - Interface to Google Charts API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Google::Chart;

  my $chart = Google::Chart->new(
    type => "Bar",
    data => [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
  );

  print $chart->as_uri, "\n"; # or simply print $chart, "\n"

  $chart->render_to_file( filename => 'filename.png' );

=head1 DESCRITPION

Google::Chart provides a Perl Interface to Google Charts API 
(http://code.google.com/apis/chart/).

Please note that version 0.05000 is a major rewrite, and has little to no
backwards compatibility.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(%args)

=over 4

=item type

Specifies the chart type, such as line, bar, pie, etc. If given a string like
'Bar', it will instantiate an instance of Google::Chart::Type::Bar by
invoking argument-less constructor.

If you want to pass parameters to the constructor, either pass in an
already instanstiated object, or pass in a hash, which will be coerced to
the appropriate object

  my $chart = Google::Chart->new(
    type => {
      module => "Bar",
      args   => {
        orientation => "horizontal"
      }
    }
  );

=item size

Specifies the chart size. Strings like "400x300", hash references, or already
instantiated objects can be used:

  my $chart = Google::Chart->new(
    size => "400x300",
  );

  my $chart = Google::Chart->new(
    size => {
      width => 400,
      height => 300
    }
  );

=item marker

Specifies the markers that go on line charts.

=item axis

Specifies the axis labels and such that go on line and bar charts

=item legend

=item color

=item fill

=back

=head2 as_uri()

Returns the URI that represents the chart object.

=head2 render()

Generates the chart image, and returns the contents.

=head2 render_to_file( %args )

Generates the chart, and writes the contents out to the file specified by
`filename' parameter

=head1 FEEDBACK

We don't believe that we fully utilize Google Chart's abilities. So there
might be things missing, things that should be changed for easier use.
If you find any such case, PLEASE LET US KNOW! Suggestions are welcome, but
code snippets, pseudocode, or even better, test cases, are most welcome.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item Standardize Interface

Objects need to expect data in a standard format. This is not the case yet.
(comments welcome)

=item Moose-ish Errors

I've been reported that some Moose-related errors occur on certain platforms.
I have not been able to reproduce it myself, so if you do, please let me
know.
